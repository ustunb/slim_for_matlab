``slim-matlab`` is a package to create SLIM scoring systems using MATLAB and the CPLEX Optimization Studio.

## Scoring Systems

*Scoring systems* are simple models to make quick predictions by adding, subtracting and multiplying a few numbers:

## SLIM

[SLIM](http://http//arxiv.org/abs/1502.04269/) is a new classification method for building data-driven scoring systems. SLIM is special in that it produces models that are fully optimized for accuracy and sparsity, and that satisfy difficult constraints **without parameter tuning** (e.g. hard limits on model size, sensitivity, specificity)

## Requirements

``slim-matlab`` was developed using MATLAB 2014b and CPLEX V12.6. It may work with earlier versions of MATLAB and/or CPLEX, but this has not been tested and will not be supported.

### Obtaining and Installing CPLEX

*CPLEX* is cross-platform commercial optimization solver that can be called from MATLAB. It is freely available to students and faculty members at accredited institutions as part of the IBM Academic Initiative. To get the latest version of CPLEX, you should:

1. Join the [IBM Academic Initiative](https://ibm.onthehub.com/WebStore/Account/SelectVerificationType.aspx)
2. Download *IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.6* (or higher) from the [software catalog](https://ibm.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=6fcc1096-7169-e611-9420-b8ca3a5db7a1)
3. Install CPLEX on your machine. Note: Mac/Unix users will [need to install a from .bin file](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21444285)
4. Add the CPLEX API to your MATLAB search path using ``pathtool``/``addpath`` [as shown here](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.6.1/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/MATLAB/topics/gs_install.html)

If you have problems installing CPLEX, check the [CPLEX user manual](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P/welcome) or the [CPLEX forums](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/forum?id=11111111-0000-0000-0000-000000002059).
